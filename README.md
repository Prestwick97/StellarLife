# _StarLife_

#### _An application that allows users to simulate the lifecycle of a star, May 8th, 2020_

#### By _**Patrick S. Delaney**_

### Welcome to the React portion of this application!

## Description

_In this application, users will (eventually) be able to run simulations of a star's lifecycle. Simulations will vary depending on the manipulations made to the star's mass at birth. As well as the timeline._

## Project pivot ✨
_Originally, this project was going to be an interactive site build with React and Three.js. However, after some time spent with development errors I decided to use Babylon.js instead of Three.js for animations. The animations have not yet been encorporated into this React application, but they will be at a later date. At this time, the project proposal in the Composition folder is outdated. Thank you!_

## Specs

* Behavior: Star will begin it's life as a low-mass star.
	* Input: solarMass = 1
	* Output: *This star will begin it's journey as a low-mass star.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _navigate to your desktop directory using your terminal: `cd desktop`._
* _clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/StellarLife.git`._
* _open the project directory in your code editor : `cd StellarLife`, `code .`_
* _install all neccessary packages needed to run the program: `npm install`._
* _run the program to open in your local server: `npm run start`._
* _Enjoy the beautiful static page_
## Known Bugs

_At this point in development, only the static site works._

## React Specifications

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
